### BL-SARIF-STDOUT — static-analysis tools write to stdout, corrupting `--output sarif`

The core static-analysis tools (`packages/core/src/tools/{runner,semgrep,cpd}.ts`)
write progress/diagnostic output to stdout. When the CLI is run with
`--quick --output sarif`, that tool stdout INTERLEAVES with the SARIF JSON the
command emits on stdout, so a CI consumer can receive MIXED/corrupt SARIF.

PRE-EXISTING and ORTHOGONAL to the forge work (Fix-Between-SDDs) — it predates
the `--pr` post-back and is not introduced by it. Surfaced during the P3 4vr
review. NOTE: it makes the `--pr` + SARIF CI scenario's MACHINE output (the SARIF
artifact) unreliable until fixed, even though the human-readable post-back is
fine. Fix = route tool stdout to stderr (or a buffer) so stdout carries ONLY the
chosen `--output` payload. Do NOT fix inside a forge diff.

## RESOLVED

### BL-WEBHOOK-401-RETRY — webhook forge calls have no in-request 401 retry

**Status: RESOLVED (by-design / won't-fix) — a bounded 401-retry adds no real
value for the webhook; closed with a diagnostic-logging improvement instead.**

The review worker (`apps/server/src/queues/review.ts`) wires an in-job bounded
401-retry on its postback BECAUSE it CACHES the installation token across a
long-running poll: a cached token can go stale mid-job, so on a `ForgeAuthError`
(HTTP 401/403) it `invalidate()`s the provider, re-mints, and retries ONCE.

The webhook handler (`apps/server/src/routes/webhook.ts` issue_comment) is
structurally different: it mints a FRESH installation token PER REQUEST
(`getInstallationToken`, no caching/TTL provider) and uses it within the SAME
short-lived request. A 401/403 on a token minted milliseconds ago is therefore a
GENUINE revocation/suspension/permission change — re-minting another fresh token
and retrying would MOSTLY fail the SAME way. The only window an in-request
re-mint could recover is a permission/token change racing BETWEEN the two forge
calls of a single request (astronomically rare). So a bounded re-mint+retry here
is pure scope with effectively no window to protect — NOT worth the code.

The proportionate fix shipped instead (commit on `feat/forge-backlog-cleanup`):
both webhook forge calls (`addReaction` ack + `fetchChangeRequest`) stay
NON-CRITICAL (a failure never fails the review), AND a `ForgeAuthError` (401/403)
is now SURFACED as a CLEAR, diagnosable `logger.error` ("installation token
rejected; check the GitHub App installation/permissions for this repo") via an
`isForgeAuthError(error)` branch — instead of being lumped into a generic
"failed" warn. A test (`handles a forge 401 on a freshly-minted token
gracefully`) confirms a 401 on both calls does not crash the webhook and the
review still dispatches (202).

RE-OPEN ONLY IF the webhook ever adopts a cached `ForgeCredentialProvider`
(e.g. shares the review worker's `GitHubAppCredentialProvider`). Then a CACHED
token COULD go stale mid-request and the worker's `invalidate → re-mint →
retry-once` block would have a real window to protect — mirror it on the webhook
forge calls at that point.

### BL-CLI-FORGE-COMPOSITION — extract a generic forge post-back helper for P4

**Status: RESOLVED** by P4 (commit `558c21e`, "feat(cli): add ghagga review
--mr (GitLab) via shared composition helper (P4)").

`resolvePrToken` / `handlePrPostback` (apps/cli) were GitHub-shaped: token
resolution, remote parsing (`parseGitHubRemote`), adapter construction
(`GitHubForgeAdapter`), and ref building all assumed GitHub. P4's `--mr` (GitLab)
should NOT duplicate this. The fix extracted a generic
`resolve-token → build-adapter+ref → post` helper parameterized by forge kind,
so `--pr` and `--mr` are thin wrappers.

Resolved by `composeForgePostback` in `apps/cli/src/lib/forge-postback.ts`: it
captures the SHARED pipeline once (`resolveToken → buildComposition → post`
via the forge-neutral `postSummaryComment`), with the forge-specific steps
(token env vars, remote→`RepoRef` parsing, adapter construction, project-id
resolution) injected through a `ForgeCompositionBuilder`. Both the `--pr`
(GitHub) and `--mr` (GitLab) command glue now route through it instead of each
hand-rolling the composition. Adding a third forge (Gitea) is a new builder, not
a new branch.
