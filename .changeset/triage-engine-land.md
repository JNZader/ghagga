Add `ghagga-triage-engine`, a self-contained, forge-agnostic (GitHub + GitLab) package for config-driven, code-aware issue triage with Playwright-based reproduction (keywords -> scan -> rerank -> expand -> locate, plus reproduce/triage/queue stages), and wire a `ghagga triage` CLI command on top of it. Export the `issue-triage` agent (`runIssueTriage`, `ISSUE_TRIAGE_SYSTEM`) and its supporting prompt-injection defenses (full boundary-marker defanging, `sanitizeLabel`) from `ghagga-core`.
